**Introduction:**
The self-driving car project combines Raspberry Pi, Arduino, a 4-wheel chassis kit, and various sensors including servo motors, ultrasonic sensors, and IR sensors. This ambitious undertaking aims to create an autonomous vehicle capable of navigating and making decisions based on sensor inputs.

**Operation**:
The Raspberry Pi serves as the brain of the car, processing sensor data and implementing decision-making algorithms. The Arduino interfaces with the 4-wheel chassis kit, controlling the motor movements and ensuring smooth navigation.

**Results:**
The self-driving car successfully demonstrates autonomous navigation in controlled environments. It can avoid obstacles using ultrasonic sensors and adapt to changing light conditions with IR sensors. The servo motor allows for precise steering and direction changes.

**Method:**

Hardware Setup: Assemble the 4-wheel chassis kit, attach the Raspberry Pi and Arduino, and connect the servo motor, ultrasonic sensor, and IR sensor.

Sensor Integration: Program the Raspberry Pi to read data from the ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection and IR sensor for light conditions.

Decision Algorithms: Develop algorithms for the Raspberry Pi to interpret sensor data and make navigation decisions.

Motor Control: Use the Arduino to control the motors and ensure coordinated movements based on the decisions made by the Raspberry Pi.

Testing and Refinement: Test the car in various scenarios, making adjustments to algorithms and sensor calibrations as needed for improved performance.
